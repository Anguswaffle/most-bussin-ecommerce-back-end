  ## Description

  Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. I was tasked with developing a way for the industry to be expanded to $29,000,000,000,001. This database program launches from the command-line and keeps track of data in a variety of tables including cAtEgOrIeS, tAgS, and PrOdUcTs.
